# Auto Email System

![photo](email.png)

This is an auto email system I created in September, 2024 to send emails to multiple contacts in a batch. This is used for sending promotion emails for the subscribers of my Notion page, after they filled their addresses in a Google form.

It's a process for creating an auto-email system using Python, Gmail, Google Forms, and Google Sheets. 

By collecting emails via a Google Form, extracting information from Google Sheets, I can send personalized emails(basically change contact names) to everyone using Python scripts.

Key components include functions for sending single and multiple emails, a secure confirmation system for email content, and a method for reading contacts from a CSV file (though replaced with Google sheets).
