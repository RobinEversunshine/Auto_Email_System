# Auto_Email_System
An email system I made to send emails to multiple contacts in a batch.

It's a process for creating an auto-email system using Python, Gmail, Google Forms, and Google Sheets. 
By collecting emails via a Google Form, extracting information from Google Sheets, I can send personalized emails(basically change contact names) to everyone using Python scripts. 
Key components include functions for sending single and multiple emails, a secure confirmation system for email content, and a method for reading contacts from a CSV file (though not used).
